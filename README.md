Adds list of domains to PiHole
----------------------------------------

sudo ./AddDomain.pl -l file.list

Note:
-------
The current lists are from https://github.com/sjhgvr/oisd.git
I won't update them here. You should:
- Clone that repository (git clone https://github.com/sjhgvr/oisd.git)
- Use my script with the dbl_*.txt that you want
- Update that repository every now and then and re-add the domains wtih my script (git pull)
